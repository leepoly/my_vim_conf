## Thanks for
vundle, my vim configuration can be synchronized between multiple devices.

This repository is migrated from pathogen to vundle, which is able to
install plugins automatically. **NOTE: Now vundle must be initiated first.**

## This REPO is for

these people:

- first, of course, myself
- new vimer, who does not have enough experience or time to collect some useful
plugins themselves.

## How to

Let $vimConf be where you store this repository, and git clone this repo to
$vimConf.Then link vim and vimrc to your home:

``` shell

mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_bak
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_bak
cd ~
ln -s $vimConf/vim .vim
ln -s $vimConf/vimrc_py .vimrc   # if you write python only
ln -s $vimConf/vimrc_full .vimrc   # if you write C++, go...
```

### Vundle

Initiate vundle

``` shell

cd $vimConf
git submodule update --init vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
Now, you can use vundle to install vim plugins automatically....

### Plugins

Jedi and supertab are recommended for pythoners. If you write python only,
just skip YCM installation.

#### YCM Installation
For Cppers, YCM is recommended.
Because it helps completion in not only coding, but also many other editing
stuff, although it's heavy...
**I do not recommend to install automatically YCM with vundle, especially in China...**
Because of poor accessibility to github,
the download rate is usually lower than 200 KiB/s.
In consequence, automated installation might be failed, and a manual
installation tells you where you failed...
To avoid this, an git proxy or manual installation is suggested.

I'll show you how to install it manually:

``` shell

cd $vimConf
git submodule update --init vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe # clone YCM

cd vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
git submodule update --init --recursive # clone dependent modules
```

**NOTE that YCM is not fully installed yet!**
For more functions, such as C++ navigation and completion, you need to go to
[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
to find proper instructions for your language. Because it depends tightly on your
linux distribution and language, these instructions are not listed here.

Here are some tips during installation of YCM:

- You'd better install/compile vim8 with python support.
For ubuntu 14, there are some PPAs providing vim8 binary;
For centos, I compiled it from sources...
- For CPPer, packages like cmake and python-dev must be installed;
- **Very Important:** If your vim support python2
execute install.py with python2; The same to python3.
- If you are not CPPer, don't add "--clang-completer" option to save time.

#### Other Plugins Installation

After installation of YCM, installing other plugins should be much easier.
Enter vim, switch to command mode and use command:

```
:PluginInstall
```

to install other plugins (such as jedi, and badwolf).

### Tmux

If you use tmux and use Ctrl+A for instruction escape.

```
cd $vimConf
git submodule update --init tmux
cd ~
mv ~/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf_bak
ln -s $vimConf/tmux/.tmux.conf .
```

### FAQ
1. After YCM installed, why my vim says " YCM error. The ycmd server SHUT DOWN (restart witâ€¦the instructions in the documentation "?
A: First you should have your pluginInstall finished, then go to $vimConf/bundle/YouCompleteMe
```
python install.py
```
to see if you have any dependency pack missing.
After I installed `cmake`, things went well.
